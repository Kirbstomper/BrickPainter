# BrickPaint


Using the Rebrickable API (https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/docs/) you can find if all of a color in a given set are availible in other colors. For example with set # 10252-1 the volkswagen beetle, I want the car to be green rather than blue. So using BrickPainter you can use Dark Azure as colorA and Green as colorB to find what can be replaced to obtain the desired end color.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
